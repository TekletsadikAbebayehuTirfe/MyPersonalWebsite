                                        <p>
                                            I was born on the fourth of February 2000 G.C in Zewditu Hospital. At that time my two <br> brothers namely Misikir and Habtamu 
                                            were 9 and 7 years old respectively.Having them <br> around made my upcoming a lot easier since having an elderly makes you more
                                            alert than <br> those that do not since we tend to gather information easily from them instead of looking <br> somewhere else. 
                                             The strangest thing about my growth was the fact that, unlike most children,<br> I was not able to walk until the age of 1. Back then
                                            the neighbour's children started walking before<br> the age of 1 so my dad used to be mad at me (so I was told). Then on my first
                                            year's birthday, the strangest <br> thing happened; I stood on my own two feet and started walking only fo fall from the stairs. 
                                            That was my <br> first major accident during childhood, of course among the others. So that's how my earliest days went by. <br>

                                        <p>
                                            At the age of 3, I joined Addis Alem Kindergarten, a school near my house; that made my transport easier <br> 
                                            but above all my mom's worries since she feared that sending a kid to a school far away causes problems. <br>
                                             I attended my school there for 2 years before graduating and joining the first grade. I did not learn KG's 3 <br>
                                              because I skipped it since I was the top of my class. But later I found that skipping classes is not a good <br>
                                               practice because you don't know what you might be missing. I was not shy at all duringmy early days I even <br> 
                                               presented a poem on my graduation day, infront of the whole class; that was the first time that I made my mom <br>
                                                proud, I remember her telling this to every guest who came to our house during the after party. After that, a <br>
                                                 new life in Yemane Birhane Primary and Secondary School began.
                                       
                                        </p>
                                    
                                        <p>
                                            I joined Yemane Birhane in 1999 E.C; I was quiet during the first 2 weeks or so until I made some friends, <br>
                                             but afterwards, you know how kids are; I was all over the place running around and having lots of fun. On <br>
                                              the first semester I was ranked fifth out of 55 students, I guessed that made me mad a bit since I wasn't used <br>
                                               to being beaten. On the second semester, however, I got the second rank; above all people including my mom <br>
                                                I was the one that was the happiest. So for the other 3 years I was ther I ended all semesters being the top of <br>
                                                 my class until I was moved to Akaki Kale Heywet Church School where I remained top for other 5 years.


                                        </p>
                                    
                                            <p>
                                                It was on fifth grade that I joined Kale Heywet, I wasn't quiet as I was in Yemane Birhane since I found <br>
                                                 some kids that I know from our village. The education system and the teacher's quality was more robust <br>
                                                  than Yemane Birhane may be that was the reason that my family decided to switch schools. There was <br>
                                                   somewhat strange but competetive rule in Kale Heywet and it was that if you become a top of your class <br>
                                                    for 3 successive semesters, then your education fee for one year will be covered by the school. That created <br>
                                                     a real compitition among fellow students, and that also made me more alert and careful not to have my <br>
                                                      place taken. 5 Years go by like this and I finished tenth grade scoring with a score of 4.0 and move on to <br>
                                                       New English Private School to attend my preparatory education.

                                            </p>
                                      
                                            <p>
                                                New English Private School short for NEPS was a different kind of school for me compared to the other <br>
                                                 two. Lots of student from abroad attended there; for instance: England, Nigeria, USA, Jamaica and so on. <br>
                                                  I guess now that I think about it, it helped me improve my language skills. But as much as I can I tried to <br>
                                                   stay Ethiopian by only speaking amharic unless it's very demanding. The school tried to follow a different <br>
                                                    type of curriculum than other preparatory schools but it did not work out well for them; but they had incredible <br>
                                                     teachers whom I have learnt so many things from, and out of all teachers, one stands out, Yonas Kibret. <br>
                                                      He was my physics teacher and the author of the book "Alpha Physics". His teaching techniques were quite <br>
                                                       outstanding and his advies were so constructive and empowering. He also made me want to teach someday. <br>
                                                        Two years passed like this and I took the enterance exam and score 536 and join Addis Ababa University.
                                            </p>
                                       
                                            <p>
                                                Another chapter began here in AAU, new friends, new curriculum and so on. I admit I got a bit intimidated <br>
                                                 by joining AAU, and this led my grades to be lower. And later that year my father had cancer, that was the <br>
                                                  most difficult times of my life because all he and I ever wanted was to see me on that stage wearing that <br>
                                                   graduation gown. He died in August 30 2011 E.C. I was devastated that I finished this first semester with an <br>
                                                    extremely low grade. But now that I've realized it I should honor him by being the person he wanted me to <br>
                                                     be so step by step I'm trying to become that person and the help of my friends and family in doing so is priceless.
                                            </p>
                                       
                                            <p>
                                                As I mentioned earlier, I have two brothers Misikir Ketema and Habtamu Ketema they are the stepping stones <br>
                                                 for where I am now by sacrficing their time and energy so that I could be better. Misikir is a health officer in <br>
                                                  Betehl Hospital while Habtamu works in Ethio Air Lines. The other pillars for me are my friends who I see as <br>
                                                   my brothers from another mother, Sintayehu, Dawit, Amanuel, Abrham, Yeabsira, and Samuel who always strive <br>
                                                    to make me a better person than I am today. I am truly grateful for having them in my life. So that was the slight <br>
                                                     glimpse of my life summed up.
