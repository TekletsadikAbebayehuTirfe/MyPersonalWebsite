        <p>
            My Hobbies are not just hobbies; they are also my gateways that relieve me from pressure, 
            sorrow or just a bad day. These are soccer, music and weightlifting. I started to develop my passion for soccer so early undet the influence of my brother 
Habtamu who is a number one Arsenal fan. Thanks to him I am also the fan of the gunners. 
was so little when Arsenal last won the premier league but I witnessed about 4 FA cups.
My favourite player from the squad is the German magician Mesut Ozil. I always admired his vision which largely showed his intellegence on the pitch and I wish someday in some way I 
could express my respect towards him. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Music is my other favourite things to do. I listen almost all types of genres like rap, pop R&B, soul. 
            oldies both from Ethiopia and abroad. I am a huge fan of renowned artists like Mohammud Ahmed,Teferi Negash, Aregahegn Worash, Neway Debebe and Teddy Afro. From females
I enjoy listening to Gigi, Mikaya, and Zeritu. I am also a fan of music abroad; specially rap/
I am a huge fan of Eminem in this genre since he transformed this so called black music to a whole
international level. So simply put music is my therapy. </p>
<p>
    Last but not least is weight lifting. I not only lift weights but also do cardio training for
my  endurance during football matches. I try to give my all on the pitch so inorder to do that 
I need to hit the gym at least 3 days a week to meet my standards as long as this schedule does
not clash with my syllabus.
