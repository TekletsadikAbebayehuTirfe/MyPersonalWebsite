                                            My Hobbies are not just hobbies; they are also my gateways that relieve me from pressure, <br>
                                            sorrow or just a bad day. These are soccer, music and weightlifting. I started to develop my <br> passion for soccer so early undet the influence of my brother 
Habtamu who is a number one <br> Arsenal fan. Thanks to him I am also the fan of the gunners. 
was so little when Arsenal last <br> won the premier league but I witnessed about 4 FA cups.
My favourite player from the squad <br> is the German magician Mesut Ozil. I always admired his vision which largely showed his <br> intellegence on the pitch and I wish someday in some way I 
could express my respect towards <br> him.

                                            Music is my other favourite things to do. I listen almost all types of genres like rap, pop R&B, <br> soul. 
                                            oldies both from Ethiopia and abroad. I am a huge fan of renowned artists like Mohammud <br> Ahmed,Teferi Negash, Aregahegn Worash, Neway Debebe and Teddy Afro. From females
I enjoy <br> listening to Gigi, Mikaya, and Zeritu. I am also a fan of music abroad; specially rap/
I am a huge <br> fan of Eminem in this genre since he transformed this so called black music to a whole
international  <br> level. So simply put music is my therapy. </p>

                                            Last but not least is weight lifting. I not only lift weights but also do cardio training for
my  endurance <br> during football matches. I try to give my all on the pitch so inorder to do that 
I need to hit the gym <br> at least 3 days a week to meet my standards as long as this schedule does
not clash with my syllabus.
