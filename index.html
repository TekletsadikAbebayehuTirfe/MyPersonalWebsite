                                            I love variety and novel challenges, and I love to solve problems and get things done, 
                                            so I decided to start using my skills in new ways by doing consultancy work. I now run my 
                                            own small consultancy business that focuses on leadership and improvement with a special focus on 
                                            healthcare, and through this I have worked with a number of  companies in the healthcare field as 
                                            well as several non-healthcare businesses, helping them to take forward innovative ideas, generate business models and improve their performance.
