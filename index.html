                                            so I decided to start using my skills in new ways by doing consultancy work. I now run my

                                            healthcare, and through this I have worked with a number of  companies in the healthcare field as

                                        <p>
                                            I’m a doctor that applies entrepreneurial thinking in healthcare (and outside healthcare too). In my clinical and management jobs in the health service I always look for opportunities for improvement and challenge the status quo.

I promote medical leadership and doctorpreneurialism through courses and conferences including the first series of annual Northern Ireland Medical Leadership Symposiums.  The last symposium – MLS2013 – was on Friday 21 June 2013 in Titanic Belfast. You can find out more on the dedicated Medical Leadership Symposium website http://medleadsymposium.co.uk.

I am the founder of HSC Changeday, an initiative to bring the NHS Changeday movement to Northern Ireland.  I led a team of volunteers from various parts of the HSC to deliver the first HSC Changeday on 3 March 2014 and we celebrated the second, bigger and better change day on 11 March 2015.  Check out the HSC Changeday website and follow HSC Changeday on Twitter.

This is my personal website where I plan to write about the things I’m interested in, share what I’m learning and give updates on the interesting work and projects I’m involved in. You can also hire me to help you, your team, or your organisation to solve a problem or improve your performance
